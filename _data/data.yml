    The patent section in a resume is a dedicated section where you can showcase any patents that you have been granted or are in the process of obtaining. This section is particularly relevant for individuals who work in scientific or technical fields, as well as for individuals who have developed innovative products or technologies.

    In this section, you should list the title of the patent, the name of the inventors, the patent number, and the date it was granted. If the patent is pending, you can indicate that it is "pending" or "in review." You may also want to provide a brief description of the technology or invention that the patent covers.

    Including a patent section in your resume can help demonstrate your expertise and accomplishments in your field, and can help you stand out from other candidates. However, if you do not have any patents to list, it is not necessary to include this section in your resume.

    Template for a pending patent:

    + [Inventor Name]. [Pursued Year]. [Title]. [Patent Number], filed [Submitted Date]. Patent pending.

    Template for an approved patent:

    + [Inventor Name]. [Pursued Year]. [Title]. [Patent Number], filed [Submitted Date], [Received Date].

    The organization section in a resume, specifically for social contexts, is a section where you can showcase any relevant involvement or leadership positions in social, cultural, or community organizations. This section can highlight your commitment to social causes and your ability to work collaboratively with others towards a common goal.

    In this section, you can list the name of the organization, your role and responsibilities, the duration of your involvement, and any significant achievements or accomplishments. You can also mention any skills or qualities you gained from your involvement, such as leadership, teamwork, communication, or problem-solving skills.

    This section can be especially valuable for candidates seeking positions in the non-profit sector, social work, or community engagement roles, where experience in social or cultural organizations can demonstrate a genuine passion for social causes and a willingness to work collaboratively towards social change. However, it is important to only include organizations that are relevant to the job you are applying for, and avoid listing organizations that may be controversial or potentially offensive.
